To get started on development you will need Visual Studio. The main project currently targets Windows 8.1 SDK and .NET Framework 2.0 so make sure to install those, as well as .NET desktop development.

The misc. projects target VC++ 2013, which is currently unopenable in the newest VS. For the moment you can just copy their .dll and .exe files from the main release since they are not updated often.

Pull requests are welcome, but if you make an update that modifies the miner files you will have to coordinate with me since they are downloaded separately.
