`Xmr-Stak` is currently the only miner that is supported on all device types in NHML. It relies heavily on a file-based config system, which replaces ELPs for it.

## Intensity

Intensity is tweaked through the config files, elaborated in the next section. For adjusting CPU intensity, modify the `cpu.txt` config template and remove/add entries of `cpu_threads_conf`.

## Config

In the `bin\xmr-stak` directory there are a couple JSON files. These will be generated on the first time running `Xmr-Stak`. There are files each for general config, pool selection, CPU, AMD, and NVIDIA. Generally, each file will have two types of copies:

* A template copy that was generated by `Xmr-Stak`.
* A copy modified by NHML at runtime that adjusts values from the template for use while mining.

For this reason, only adjust the "template" files, since the modified files are overwritten at each launch. E.g. a template file will look like `amd.txt`, whereas the modified version will look like `AMD_0.txt`. NHML writes a warning comment in the file header for the modified versions so you can tell if you see that.

The template files all have instructions on how the values can be tweaked.
